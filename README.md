English Premier League Match Analysis & Prediction

This project explores match-level data from the **English Premier League (EPL)** and builds a machine learning pipeline to predict outcomes using **rolling statistics** over past matches. The focus is on transforming raw match data into meaningful features to improve predictive performance.

Project Overview

The core idea is to:

- Load and clean EPL match data.
- Compute rolling averages (last 5, 15, and 38 matches) for:
  - Goals scored/conceded
  - Shots
  - Corners
  - Fouls
- Use the transformed dataset to build a predictive model that can be used for forecasting future match outcomes or performance.



Key Features

- Rolling feature engineering for statistical smoothing
- Match-specific transformation pipeline
- Easy to integrate with classification or regression ML models
- Modular notebook for end-to-end execution


 Repository Structure


football-epl-analysis/
├── football.ipynb            Main notebook with feature engineering
├── data/                     Folder for raw & processed data
├── models/                   Trained models (optional)
├── README.md                 Project documentation
└── requirements.txt          List of dependencies




Installation

To run this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-epl-analysis.git
cd football-epl-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt




Usage

Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook football.ipynb
```

Or convert it to a Python script for automation:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script football.ipynb
python football.py



Example Output

The output includes rolling features like:

- `home_team_goals_rolling5`
- `away_team_shots_rolling15`
- `home_corners_rolling38`

Which can be used as input to models like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.


Future Work

- Integrate match odds for betting-related prediction
- Add player-level statistics
- Implement match outcome prediction models (e.g., win/draw/loss)
